- Library files to include:
 - Page Manager

- Finish BaseModel class

- General Error conditions - ie missing controller, model etc and default error displays

- Error bin class, error handling functions etc

- Make Collection class implement Iterator

- Allow updating of any variable in Collection class - to propagate through all member objects

- Schemas to come directly from DB info rather than manual XML files. Perhaps use MySQL relationships as well?
