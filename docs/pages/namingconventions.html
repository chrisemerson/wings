    <h1>Naming Conventions</h1>

    <a href="../index.html" class="back">&lt; Back</a>

    <p>Certain classes and files within the Wings framework have different naming conventions, so the Loader class can determine
    what it needs to do when it comes across a class name that isn't loaded yet.</p>

    <p>All class names in the system are CamelCased with an uppercased initial letter, and most end in a name which describes
    their role in the system (eg Controller, View, Driver).</p>

    <p>All filenames in Wings are lowercase letters only, and usually have the format
    <span class="file"><var>type</var>.<var>name</var>.php</span>, although there are exceptions to this. The details for each
    class type are listed below, in the order they are checked for by the <a href="loader.html">Loader</a> class.</p>

    <h2>DB Drivers</h2>

    <p>The names of <a href="dbdrivers.html">DB Drivers</a> are CamelCased with an uppercased initial letter, and live in a file
    called <span class="file">sys/dbdrivers/db.<var>name</var>.php</span>.</p>

    <p>For example, a DB Driver called MySQLi would live in the file
    <span class="file">sys/dbdrivers/db.mysqli.php</span>, and consist of the following structure:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  class MysqliDriver implements iDBDriver {

  }//class</code></pre>

    <h2>Controllers</h2>

    <p>The names of <a href="controllers.html">Controllers</a> must be CamelCased with an uppercased initial letter, and live in
    a file called <span class="file">app/controllers/controller.<var>name</var>.php</span>.</p>

    <p>For example, a Controller called SomeExample would live in the file
    <span class="file">app/controllers/controller.someexample.php</span>, and consist of the following structure:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  class SomeExampleController extends BaseController {

  }//class</code></pre>

    <p>There are some built in controllers in <span class="folder">sys/controllers/</span> which are loaded if no view is found
    in <span class="folder">app/controllers/</span>. These can be overridden by copying the file into
    <span class="folder">app/controllers/</span>, and modifying the copy.</p>

    <h2>Views</h2>

    <p>The names of <a href="views.html">Views</a> must be CamelCased with an uppercased initial letter, and live in
    a file called <span class="file">app/views/view.<var>name</var>.php</span>.</p>

    <p>For example, a View called SomeExample would live in the file
    <span class="file">app/views/view.someexample.php</span>, and consist of the following structure:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  class SomeExampleView extends BaseView {

  }//class</code></pre>

    <p>There are some built in views in <span class="folder">sys/views/</span> which are loaded if no view is found in
    <span class="folder">app/views/</span>. These can be overridden by copying the file into
    <span class="folder">app/views/</span>, and modifying the copy.</p>

    <h2>Collections</h2>

    <p><a href="collections.html">Collections</a> are special objects within Wings that are created on the fly, so they have no
    associated file. They represent a set of the same <a href="models.html">Model</a>, and various operations can be performed
    on them. They automatically extend the <a href="collection.html">Collection</a> class which provides this functionality, and
    the creation of these objects are handled by the <a href="loader.html">Loader</a> class.</p>

    <p>The name must conisist of the name of a <a href="models.html">Model</a> recognised by the system, followed by the word
    'Collection'. For example, if there was a <a href="models.html">Model</a> with the name 'SomeExample', you can create a
    'SomeExampleCollection' object, which would be created on the fly. If an unrecognised <a href="models.html">Model</a> name
    is used, the usual PHP error will be thrown for a class which isn't found.</p>

    <h2>Models</h2>

    <p><a href="models.html">Models</a> are another special type of object in Wings which can be created on the fly, but can
    also be overridden with a file containing custom code.</p>

    <p>Models are also special in that they have no prexix to their class name. This is so that manipulation of data and
    persistent objects within the system can be more natural (eg 'User' rather than 'UserModel').

    <p>When a class name is passed to the <a href="loader.html">Loader</a> class that isn't recognised as any of the above, it
    first checks the <span class="folder">app/models/</span> folder for a file called
    <span class="file">model.<var>name</var>.php</span>. If it is found, this file is loaded. The basic structure of this file
    should follow this syntax (for a <a href="models.html">Model</a> named 'SomeExample'):</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  class SomeExample extends BaseModel {

  }//class</code></pre>

    <p>If no such file is found, and the name is a recognised model name, a class with the basic structure above is created and
    used instead. Thus, for models which require no custom functionality, no file is needed to be created.</p>

    <h2>Library Files</h2>

    <p>If the class name does not have one of the recognised extensions, and is not a recognised model name, it is checked to
    see if it is a library file. These files live in <span class="folder">app/lib/</span> and
    <span class="folder">sys/lib/</span>, with files in the former being used in preference to those in the latter. The filename
    should simply be <span class="file">lib/class.<var>name</var>.php"</span>. For example, for the library file
    <a href="convert.php">Convert</a>, the filename is <span class="file">sys/lib/class.convert.php</span>. For a new library
    class called 'SomeExample', the filename would be <span class="file">app/lib/class.someexample.php</span>.</p>
