    <h1>Authentication Class</h1>

    <a href="../index.html" class="back">&lt; Back</a>

    <p>The authentication library handles logins, remembered logins and reauthentication in a secure way. It uses the principles
    described in <a href="http://jaspan.com/improved_persistent_login_cookie_best_practice">http://jaspan.com/improved_persistent_login_cookie_best_practice</a>
    in order to provide a very secure system for dealing with user registration and logins.</p>

    <p>Additionally, logins can be remembered at multiple locations, you can forget logins at certain locations or log the user
    out from all locations if needed. If a stolen cookie is detected, the user is logged out from all locations as a
    precaution.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the module can hook into any database layout (providing certain fields are present - although field names
    don't matter), and options such as remembered login expiry time are configurable.</p>

    <p>This library file is accessible from controllers automatically as <code>$this->auth</code>.</p>

    <h2>Methods &amp; Properties</h2>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>Authentication->__construct()</code> (Constructor)</h3>

      <p>The constructor reads the config file, checks for a remembered login cookie and logs the user in if one exists.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>Authentication->attemptLogin($strUsername, $strPassword, $blnRememberMe = false, $blnRedirectAfterLogin = true)</code></h3>

      <p>Attempts a login with the details provided. You can optionally set the 3rd argument to 'true' to use the 'remember me'
      feature at this location, and the 4th argument to 'false' to prevent the system autmatically redirecting the user after
      login. This is useful if you need to do some further processing on a successful login, but before thoy are redirected.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>Authentication->redirectAfterLogin($strDefaultRedirection = '')</code></h3>

      <p>This is called automatically after a successful login, unless the user has prevented the redirect. If they have, they
      can manually invoke this method to perform the redirection. If the user got to the login page by trying to visit a page
      they couldn't access, they are sent back to the page they were originally trying to leek at. If not, they are sent to the
      location specified by the $strDefaultRedirection parameter passed to this function, or the location in the config file if
      it wasn't passed in.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>Authentication->logout()</code></h3>

      <p>Logs the user out at this location.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>Authentication->isLoggedIn()</code></h3>

      <p>Returns <code>true</code> if the user is logged in, and <code>false</code> if they are not.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>Authentication->isAuthenticatedThisSession()</code></h3>

      <p>Returns <code>true</code> if the user has re-authenticated in this session, and <code>false</code> if they have
      not.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>Authentication->requireLoggedIn($strURIToRedirectTo = '')</code></h3>

      <p>Calling this signals to the class that a user needs to be logged in to access this page. It will check if the user is
      already logged in, and if they are, do nothing. If they are not logged in, it will redirect the user to the URI set in the
      config file. Alternatively, you can override where the user is redirected by passing in the $strURIToRedirectTo
      argument.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>Authentication->requireLoggedOut($strURIToRedirectTo = '')</code></h3>

      <p>As above, but requires the user to be logged out.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>Authentication->requireReAuthentication($strURIToRedirectTo = '')</code></h3>

      <p>As above, but requires the user to be re-authenticated before continuing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>Authentication->getCurrentUser()</code></h3>

      <p>Returns a model object of the current user. What this is called depends on your configuration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>Authentication->setUserPassword(&$objUser, $strPassword)</code></h3>

      <p>Sets the password on the user model that you pass in. For example, you could write a <code>setPassword()</code> method
      within the User model that contains the following:</p>

      <pre><code>&lt;?php
  class User extends BaseModel {
    public function setPassword ($strPassword) {
      $objAuthentication = new Authentication();
      $objAuthentication->setUserPassword($this, $strPassword);
    }//function
  }//class</code></pre>

      <p>This function is needed because the process of converting a password to a hash happens within the Authentication
      class.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>Authentication->checkUserPassword(&$objUser, $strPassword)</code></h3>

      <p>This function checks the user password and returns either <code>true</code> if the correct password was supplied, or
      <code>false</code> if not.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>Authentication->clearAllRememberedLogins($intUserID = 0)</code></h3>

      <p>A call to this methed will clear all the logins that the database has saved, effectively invalidating all the
      remembered login cookies that are attached to the supplied user. If no User ID is supplied, the currently logged in user
      is used.</p>
    </div>
