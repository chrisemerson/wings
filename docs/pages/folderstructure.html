    <h1>Folder Structure</h1>

    <a href="../index.html" class="back">&lt; Back</a>

    <p>The basic folder structure of PHP Wings is shown below. The layout encourages application specific code to be separated
    from the framework code, in order to allow upgrading the framework to be as easy as possible. You can move the
    <span class="folder">app/</span> and <span class="folder">sys/</span> folders to anywhere on the system, as long as they are
    in the same folder, and you update the location in the require_once line of <span class="file">httpdocs/index.php</span>.</p>
