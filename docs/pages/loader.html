    <h1>Loader Class</h1>

    <a href="../index.html" class="back">&lt; Back</a>

    <p>The Loader class is responsible for interpreting the names of classes that aren't yet loaded in the framework, working
    out what they are and where the relevant file lives, and loading it. The <code>__autoload()</code> function in
    <span class="file">/sys/base/3.inc/inc.autoload.php</span> uses this class.</p>

    <p>The Loader class interprets the name using the framework's <a href="namingconventions.html">naming convention</a>, with
    any other names being treated as either a <a href="models.html">Model</a>, <a href="libraryfiles.html">Library Class</a> or
    <a href="thirdparty.html">Third Party Class</a> in that order of priority.</p>

    <p>This class is intended for internal use only and should not be needed by application code.</p>

    <h2>Methods & Properties</h2>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>Loader->__construct(<var>$strClassName</var>)</code> (Constructor)</h3>

      <p>The constructor takes a single argument, which is the name of the class you are attempting to load.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>Loader->load()</code></h3>

      <p>This method call prompts the class to search for the class in question and load it, according to the naming conventions
      and locations in the framework.</p>
    </div>
