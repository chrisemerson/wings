    <h1>Basic Concepts</h1>

    <a href="../index.html" class="back">&lt; Back</a>

    <p>All the back ond code is contained within <span class="folder">app/</span> and <span class="folder">sys/</span>, with
    <span class="folder">sys/</span> containing most of the framework and <span class="folder">app/</span> containing
    application specific files. Anything in <span class="folder">app/</span> will be used in preference to things in
    <span class="folder">sys/</span>, so any framework files can be overridden by copying the file from
    <span class="folder">sys/</span> then modifying it. The exceptions to this are <span class="file">inc.wings.php</span>,
    anything in the <span class="folder">base/</span> folder, and anything in the <span class="folder">dbdrivers/</span> folder,
    none of which should be overridden.</p>

    <p>The <span class="folder">httpdocs/</span> folder is where Apache should serve from, and contains the main entry point to
    the application (<span class="file">index.php</span>) as well as an <span class="file">.htaccess</span> file to route all
    requests through it. Static files also go in here, and a skeleton folder structure is provided as a starting point. Any
    requests to an existing file will first check to see if the file (or directory) exists, and if it does, the request will be
    served as normal. Any requests for a file or directory that doesn't exist is routed through the framework. If the framework
    has nothing defined to handle the request, a 404 error is shown.</p>

    <p>Including the <span class="file">inc.wings.php</span> folder is the way to use wings - eg if you want to write a simple
    test script or standalone script that uses the wings functionality, just require this file first, then you can do almost
    anything you'd normally do in a controller. The include file simply includes anything in the
    <span class="folder">sys/base/</span> folder and its sub-folders. If a <span class="file">loadorder</span> file is present,
    the files will load in the order contained within it (1 file per line, comments start with #).</p>

    <p>All filenames by convention are lowercased, and are named accerding to what they are, eg controllers are named in
    CamelCase (ExampleNameController) and lives in the file
    <span class="file">app/controllers/controller.examplename.php</span>. There are more details in the documentation for each
    of the different sections.</p>

    <p>Apart from the models, views and controllers, most of the system lives within
    <span class="folder">base/2.classes/</span>. Library files within <span class="folder">lib/</span> also act as standalone
    classes and can be called upon to help with certain tasks. Certain library files are pre-loaded into the controllers and are
    accessible within them as <code>$this-><var>name</var></code>. These include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong><code>$this->errors</code></strong> - ErrorRegistry class. Stores and handles errors globally within a request so they can
      all be displayed in the same place.</li>
      <li><strong><code>$this->post</code></strong> - InputFilter class. Performs input filtering & validation on $_POST variables.</li>
      <li><strong><code>$this->get</code></strong> - InputFilter class. As above but for $_GET variables.</li>
      <li><strong><code>$this->session</code></strong> - Session class. Used to access the session data.</li>
      <li><strong><code>$this->auth</code></strong> - Authentication class. Handles secure logins, sessions and cookies, including 'Remember
      Me' feature.</li>
      <li><strong><code>$this->files</code></strong> - FileUpload class. This isn't yet implemented, do not use.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Further information on these is available within the documentation for the class in question. To use these within a model
    or view, they need to be instantiated in the normal way.</p>
