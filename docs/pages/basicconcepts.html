    <a href="../index.html">&lt; Back</a>

    <p>Wings uses an MVC design philosiphy, with a custom built ORM and Templating system included as well.</p>

    <p>All the back ond code is contained within app/ and sys/, with sys/ containing most of the framework and app/ containing
    application specific files. Anything in app/ will be used in preference to things in sys/, so any framework files can be
    overridden by copying the file from sys then modifying it. The exceptions to this are inc.wings.php, anything in the base/
    folder, and anything in the dbdrivers/ folder, neither of which can be overridden.</p>

    <p>The httpdocs/ folder is where Apache should serve from, and contains the main entry point to the application (index.php)
    as well as an .htaccess file to route all requests through it. Static files also go in here, and a skeleton folder structure
    is provided as a starting point. Any requests to an existing file will first check to see if the file (or directory) exists,
    and if it does, the request will be served as normal. Any requests for a file or directory that doesn't exist is routed
    through the framework. If the framework has nothing defined to handle the request, a 404 error is shown.</p>

    <p>Including the inc.wings.php folder is the way to use wings - eg if you want to write a simple test script or standalone
    script that uses the wings functionality, just require this file first, then you can do almost anything you'd normally do in
    a controller. The include file simply includes anything in the sys/base/ folder and its sub-folders. If a loadorder file is
    present, the files will load in the order contained within it (1 file per line, comments start with #).</p>

    <p>All filenames by convention are lowercased, and are named accerding to what they are, eg controllers are named in
    CamelCase (ExampleNameController) and lives in the file controllers/controller.examplename.php. There are more details in
    each of the different sections.</p>

    <p>Apart from the models, views and controllers, most of the system lives within base/2.classes/. Library files within lib/
    also act as standalone classes and can be called upon to help with certain tasks. Certain library files are pre-loaded into
    the controllers and are accessible within them as $this->{name}. These include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>$this->errors</strong> - ErrorRegistry class. Stores and handles errors globally within a request so they can
      all be displayed in the same place.</li>
      <li><strong>$this->post</strong> - InputFilter class. Performs input filtering & validation on $_POST variables.</li>
      <li><strong>$this->get</strong> - InputFilter class. As above but for $_GET variables.</li>
      <li><strong>$this->session</strong> - Session class. Used to access the session data.</li>
      <li><strong>$this->auth</strong> - Authentication class. Handles secure logins, sessions and cookies, including 'Remember
      Me' feature.</li>
      <li><strong>$this->files</strong> - FileUpload class. This isn't yet implemented, do not use.</li>
