    <h1>DB Drivers</h1>

    <a href="../index.html" class="back">&lt; Back</a>

    <p>The purpose of the DB Drivers within Wings is to abstract the database functionality away from the Applications, and
    present a common interface to the parts of the Application needing to use database functionality. This allows the database
    technology to be swapped for another easily, and without any code changes required.</p>

    <p>Each Database Driver consists of 2 classes defined within a single file, one of which serves as the Database Connection
    object, and the other as a Results object. Wings has 2 interfaces which need to be implemented by every DB Driver - to
    ensure a common interface is presented to the Application no matter what database technology is being used.</p>

    <p>The main database connection object inside a DB Driver should consist of the name of the scheme you are implementing (eg
    'mysqli'), all in lowercase, apart from an initial uppercase character (in this case, 'Mysqli'). This is followed by the
    word 'Driver'. The class must implement the iDBDriver interface.</p>

    <p>The other class in the file represents the result returned by a query to the database. This can be called whatever you
    like, but a good idea is to stick with a similar naming scheme, replacing 'Driver' with 'Result'. This class must implement
    the iDBResult interface.</p>

    <p>Using the mysqli example:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  class MysqliDriver implements iDBDriver {

  }//class

  class MysqliResult implements iDBResult {

  }//class</code></pre>

    <p>The interfaces are defined as:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  interface iDBDriver {
    public function __construct ($strHost = "localhost", $strUser = "", $strPass = "", $strDBName = "", $intPort = 0);
    public function query ($strQuery);
    public function multi_query ($strQuery);
    public function escape_string ($strStringToEscape);
    public function close ();
  }//interface

  interface iDBResult {
    public function __construct ($dbResults);
    public function fetch_assoc ();
    public function data_seek ($intOffset);
    public function free ();
  }//interface</code></pre>

    <p>New DB Drivers should go in <span class="folder">app/dbdrivers/</span> and be named
    <span class="file">db.<var>name</var>.php</span>. For example, <span class="file">app/dbdrivers/db.mysqli.php</span>. To
    override one of the built in controllers, you can copy it from <span class="folder">sys/dbdrivers/</span> to
    <span class="folder">app/dbdrivers/</span> ad modify the copy.</p>
