    <h1>Controllers</h1>

    <a href="../index.html" class="back">&lt; Back</a>

    <p>Controllers in an MVC architecture act like the 'signalmen' of the application - they deal with incoming requests (each
    request is sent to a different controller and action), do any processing required (or hand this task off to the models),
    decide what view(s) need to be loaded and pass the appropriate data & models to them for rendering.</p>

    <p>The first stage in any request to the application is that the <a href="dispatcher.html">Dispatcher</a> class decides where
    the request should be routed (via <span class="config"><a href="routesconf.html">routes.xml</a></span>), and this is nearly
    always a Controller - although redirecting to another URI is also a possibility.</p>

    <p>Each dispatch consists of a Controller, an Action and optionally, 1 or more paramaters. The Controller is loaded, the
    action is used to call a publically accessible method in that controller, and the parameters are passed along to the method
    as well. The end result is that, after configuring <span class="config"><a href="routesconf.html">routes.xml</a></span>, the
    controllers serve as the effective entry point into the application, and allow you to group similar functions into the same
    controller.</p>

    <p>All controllers live in either the <span class="folder">sys/controllers/</span> folder (for built in Controllers) or the
    <span class="folder">app/controllers/</span> folder (for Application specific Controllers). If you want to override any of
    the built in controllers, first copy them into the <span class="folder">app/controllers</span> folder, and modify the copied
    version.</p>

    <p>There are some library files that are automatically loaded into each controller, and some preset methods as well. For
    instance, the <code>view</code> property is used to contain the current view intending to be displayed, and the
    <code>renderView()</code> method renders whatever is in the <code>view</code> property:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  class ExampleController extends BaseController {
    public function showExamplePage () {
      $this->view = new ExamplePageView();

      $this->renderView();
    }//function
  }//class</code></pre>

    <p>Each Controller also has a built in <code>index()</code> method, which is used if no action is specified in
    <span class="config"><a href="routesconf.html">routes.xml</a></span>.</p>

    <h2>Preloaded Library Classes</h2>

    <p>The library classes that are loaded with each request are as follows:</p>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3>BaseController->errors</h3>

      <p><a href="errorregistry.html">ErrorRegistry</a> class. Stores and handles errors globally within a request so they can all be displayed in the same place.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3>BaseController->post</h3>

      <p><a href="inputfilter.html">InputFilter</a> class. Performs input filtering & validation on $_POST variables.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3>BaseController->get</h3>

      <p><a href="inputfilter.html">InputFilter</a> class. As above but for $_GET variables.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3>BaseController->session</h3>

      <p><a href="session.html">Session</a> class. Used to access the session data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3>BaseController->auth</h3>

      <p><a href="authentication.html">Authentication</a> class. Handles secure logins, sessions and cookies, including 'Remember Me' feature.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3>BaseController->files</h3>

      <p>FileUpload class. This isn't yet implemented, do not use.</p>
    </div>

    <p>These libraries are used with the <code>$this</code> prefix when within a controller. For example:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  class ExampleController extends BaseController {
    public function showExamplePage () {
      $this->auth->requireLoggedIn();

      $this->view = new ExamplePageView();

      if (isset($this->post->action) && ($this->post->action == "test")) {
        $this->renderView();
      } else {
        Application::showError('404');
      }//if
    }//function
  }//class</code></pre>
  </body>
