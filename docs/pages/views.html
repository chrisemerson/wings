    <h1>Views</h1>

    <a href="../index.html" class="back">&lt; Back</a>

    <p>Views in the Wings framework are for outputting information made up from models and other bits of data to either the
    screen, or another file (eg XML in the case of an API or AJAX call).</p>

    <p>A view usually utilises the <a href="templates.html">template system</a> (though doesn't have to), and so has some
    methods built in for loading and dealing with <a href="templates.html">templates</a>. These include the
    <code>loadTemplate()</code> method, as well as the <code>render()</code> method, and the <code>template</code> property.</p>

    <p>Each separate 'screen' or page on the website will usually have a separate view associated with it, though small
    alterations such as showing and hiding small blocks of code can be done within the same view.</p>

    <p>All views should live inside <span class="folder">app/views/</span>, and be named
    <span class="file">view.<var>name</var>.php</span>. There are some built in views in <span class="folder">sys/views/</span>
    which can be overridden by copying the relevant file to <span class="folder">app/views/</span> and modifying the copy.</p>

    <h2>Master Views</h2>

    <p>Views in the system usually extend the MasterView class, which is associated with the master template. This is to ensure
    things that are in the master template (header, login blocks etc) are dealt with automatically on every page load. If the
    master template is not required for a certain view, you must remember to make the view extend the <code>BaseView</code>
    class instead of the <code>MasterView</code> class, and pass <code>false</code> as the second parameter of the
    <code>loadTemplate</code> method.</p>

    <p>The <code>MasterView</code> class also adds a couple of helper methods in order to add JavaScript and CSS to the page, in
    conjunction with the default master template. Be sure not to remove this part of the master template if you want this
    functionality to remain!</p>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>MasterView->addStylesheet($strStylesheetName, $strStylesheetMedia = 'screen')</code></h3>

      <p>This method adds the specified stylesheet to the page, through the master template. By default, the
      <span class="folder">httpdocs/styles/</span> folder is used.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>MasterView->addScript($strScriptName)</code></h3>

      <p>This method adds the specified JavaScript file to the page, through the master template. By default, the
      <span class="folder">httpdocs/scripts/</span> folder is used.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>A Typical View</h2>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  class HomeView extends MasterView {
    public function __construct () {
      $this->loadTemplate('home');

      parent::__construct();
    }//function

    public function render () {
      parent::render();
    }//function
  }//class</code></pre>

    <p>Nearly all views have the 2 methods <code>__construct()</code> and <code>render()</code> defined. Both of these methods
    are defined in the MasterView and BaseView classes, so every step in the chain needs to make sure it calls its parent method
    at the appropriate point.</p>

    <p>The constructor will usually load a <a href="templates.html">template</a> (using the <code>loadTemplate()</code> method),
    and then call the parent constructor with <code>parent::__construct()</code>.</p>

    <p>The <code>render()</code> method will render everything specific to that view (In this example, nothing), and then call
    the <code>render()</code> method of the parent function in order to complete rendering. The <code>render()</code> method is
    invoked when the <code>renderView()</code> method within a controller is called. A more complex example can be found
    below:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  class AdminUsersView extends MasterView {
    public function __construct () {
      $this->loadTemplate('admin.users');

      parent::__construct();
    }//function

    public function render () {
      $this->addStylesheet('admin.css');

      $this->renderUsers();

      parent::render();
    }//function

    private function renderUsers () {
      $objUsers = $this->users;

      $blnAlt = false;

      if (count($objUsers)) {
        foreach ($objUsers as $objUser) {
          $this->template->userid = $objUser->user_id;
          $this->template->useremail = $objUser->user_email_address;
          $this->template->username = $objUser->user_name;
          $this->template->alt = $blnAlt;

          $blnAlt = !$blnAlt;

          $this->template->parse('user');
        }//foreach
      } else {
        $this->template->parse('nousers');
      }//if
    }//function
  }//class</code></pre>

    <p>This template's <code>render()</code> method also adds a stylesheet (admin.css - which should live in the styles/
    folder), and also calls a private method which adds data to the template - <code>renderUsers()</code>. This method makes use
    of the Users <a href="collections.html">Collection</a> which is passed to it, loops over it and parses a particular section
    in the <a href="templates.html">template</a>. Most methods in the view are best left as private, with only the constructor
    and the <code>render()</code> method being publically accessible.</p>

    <h2>Methods & Properties</h2>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>BaseView->__construct()</code> (Constructor)</h3>

      <p>The constructor in the BaseView is empty, but should be called by any constructor in a view (as
      <code>parent::__construct()</code>), because something may be put in here in the future.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>BaseView-><var>var</var></code></h3>

      <p>Properties can be set and retrieved in this way. For example a Controller would pass its data and models to the view in
      this way, and the view would then retrieve them in the same way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>BaseView->loadData($mixNameOrArray, $strValue = "")</code></h3>

      <p>Properties can be set and retrieved in this way. For example a Controller would pass its data and models to the view in
      this way, and the view would then retrieve them in the same way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>BaseView->loadTemplate($strTemplateName, $mixMasterTemplateSetting = true)</code></h3>

      <p>This method loads the specified template and places it in the <code>BaseView->template</code> property. Additionally,
      the Master Template Setting (2nd Parameter) can be set to either true, false or the name of another template to use as the
      Master template. If it is true, the default master template is used - this is the default setting. If it is false, no
      master template is used.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>BaseView->render()</code></h3>

      <p>This method renders the final view by parsing the whole template and then outputting it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>BaseView->passthrough($strVar1[, $strVar2[, ...]])</code></h3>

      <p>This method takes a list of variable names as parameters, and passes the properties of the view with those names
      directly to the template.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>BaseView->passthroughAll()</code></h3>

      <p>This method passes all set properties through to the template.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>BaseView->coalesce($mixVar1[, $mixVar2[, ...]])</code></h3>

      <p>This is a helper function which simply outputs the first non-empty value it is passed in the list, similar to the MSSQL
      COALESCE() function.</p>
    </div>
