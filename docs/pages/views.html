    <h1>Views</h1>

    <a href="../index.html" class="back">&lt; Back</a>

    <p>Views in the Wings framework are for outputting information made up from models and other bits of data to either the
    screen, or another file (eg XML in the case of an API or AJAX call).</p>

    <p>A view usually utilises the template system (though doesn't have to), and so has some methods built in for loading and
    dealing with templates. These include the <code>loadTemplate()</code> method, as well as the <code>render()</code> method,
    and the <code>template</code> property.</p>

    <p>Each separate 'screen' or page on the website will usually have a separate view associated with it, though small
    alterations such as showing and hiding small blocks of code can be done within the same view.</p>

    <p>All views should live inside <span class="folder">app/views/</span>, and be named
    <span class="file">view.<var>name</var>.php</span>. There are some built in views in <span class="folder">sys/views/</span>
    which can be overridden by copying the relevant file to <span class="folder">app/views/</span> and modifying the copy.</p>

    <h2>Methods & Properties</h2>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>BaseView->__construct()</code> (Constructor)</h3>

      <p>The constructor in the BaseView is empty, but should be called by any constructor in a view (as
      <code>parent::__construct()</code>), because something may be put in here in the future.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>BaseView-><var>var</var></code></h3>

      <p>Properties can be set and retrieved in this way. For example a Controller would pass its data and models to the view in
      this way, and the view would then retrieve them in the same way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>BaseView->loadData($mixNameOrArray, $strValue = "")</code></h3>

      <p>Properties can be set and retrieved in this way. For example a Controller would pass its data and models to the view in
      this way, and the view would then retrieve them in the same way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>BaseView->loadTemplate($strTemplateName, $mixMasterTemplateSetting = true)</code></h3>

      <p>This method loads the specified template and places it in the <code>BaseView->template</code> property. Additionally,
      the Master Template Setting (2nd Parameter) can be set to either true, false or the name of another template to use as the
      Master template. If it is true, the default master template is used - this is the default setting. If it is false, no
      master template is used.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>BaseView->render()</code></h3>

      <p>This method renders the final view by parsing the whole template and then outputting it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>BaseView->passthrough($strVar1[, $strVar2[, ...]])</code></h3>

      <p>This method takes a list of variable names as parameters, and passes the properties of the view with those names
      directly to the template.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>BaseView->passthroughAll()</code></h3>

      <p>This method passes all set properties through to the template.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usage">
      <h3><code>BaseView->coalesce($mixVar1[, $mixVar2[, ...]])</code></h3>

      <p>This is a helper function which simply outputs the first non-empty value it is passed in the list, similar to the MSSQL
      COALESCE() function.</p>
    </div>
