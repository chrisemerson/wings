    <h1>Third Party Classes</h1>

    <a href="../index.html" class="back">&lt; Back</a>

    <p>As well as the built in and custom library files, Wings also allows for third party library files to be included and to
    make use of the framework's autoloading functionality.</p>

    <p>Wings includes PHPMailer and FPDF classes within <span class="folder">sys/lib/thirdparty/</span>, and additional classes
    can be added into <span class="folder">app/lib/thirdparty</span>. There is also a <a href="config.html">Config</a> file to
    edit (<span class="config"><a href="thirdpartyconf.html">thirdparty.xml</a></span>) to enable the
    <a href="loader.html">Loader</a> class to determine where the class lives.</p>

    <p>If you wish to upgrade or alter any of the included third party classes, you should first copy them from
    <span class="folder">sys/lib/thirdparty/</span> to <span class="folder">app/lib/thirdparty/</span>, and modify the copied
    version.</p>
