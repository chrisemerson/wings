    <h1>BaseView Class</h1>

    <a href="../index.html" class="back">&lt; Back</a>

    <p>This class serves as a base for all the views in the system, and provides them with their functionality and helper
    functions. It is abstract and cannot be instantiated on its own.</p>

    <p>Views in the framework are geared towards using the templating system provided (with methods such as
    <code>loadTemplate()</code> and <code>render()</code>, but the you are under no obligation to use this functionality, and
    can implement whatever technology you like in order to achieve the output you need.</p>

    <p>All wiews must have a <code>render()</code> method, which is the trigger that causes the view to output its content. If
    you don't provide one, the currently loaded template will be output as-is. If no template is loaded, an error will
    occur.</p>


    <h2>Basic Structure</h2>

    <pre><code>abstract class BaseView {
  protected $template;
  private   $arrData = array();

  protected function __construct ()
  protected function loadTemplate ($strTemplateName, $mixMasterTemplateSetting = true)
