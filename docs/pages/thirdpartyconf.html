    <p>This file contains the locations of third party software which has been added into the framework, and allows them to be
    used with the autoloader. The elements (under the root element) are the lowercase versions of class names that can be
    instantiated, and the content of each element is the filename of the PHP file where this class can be found.</p>

    <p>To override the settings, first copy the file from <span class="folder">sys/config/</span> to
    <span class="folder">app/config/</span>, and modify the copy.</p>

&lt;!-- Each child of the thirdparty root node should be the name of the class,
and the value the file to be included, relative to the thirdparty folder --&gt;
