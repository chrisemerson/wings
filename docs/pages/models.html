    <h1>Models</h1>

    <a href="../index.html" class="back">&lt; Back</a>

    <p>The Models in the system represent the data & services used by the application, and the structure of Models in Wings
    consists of a basic ORM.</p>

    <p>It is designed to have minimal configuration or code required in order to use the default functionality, while still
    allowing full customisation.</p>

    <p>All the database models are stored in <span class="config"><a href="modelsconf.html">models.xml</a></span>, which defines
    their names, the plurals of their names, and the database tables they live in. Additionally, the relationships between these
    models can be defined in <span class="config"><a href="relationshipsconf.html">relationships.xml</a></span>, which enables
    simple function calls to get related objects. More information about these 2 config files can be found on their relevant
    pages.</p>

    <p>Throughout this page, the example will consist of an imaginary Blog Post, which is created by a User, and contains
    several Comments. The example schemas are as follows:</p>

    <h2>Basic CRUD Functionality</h2>

    <p>Models can be created by simply creating a new object with the name of the model. For example:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  $objBlogPost = new BlogPost();</code></pre>

    <p>This will create a new model object which represents a blog post. If no differing plural is defined in
    <span class="config"><a href="modelsconf.html">models.xml</a></span>, the default is to add an 's' on to the end (ie,
    BlogPosts), and for the table name, the default is to add underscores between words of the plural form and lowercase the
    entire word. Words are determined by the camelCasing of the model name. So, for the 'BlogPost' model, Wings expects the
    plural to be 'BlogPosts' and the table name to be 'blog_posts'. Database prefixes are automatically added according to the
    ->db->prefix setting in <span class="config"><a href="appconf.html">app.xml</a></span>.</p>

    <p>Essentially, any class that extends the <a href="basemodel.html">BaseModel</a> class will recieve all the ORM
    functionality, with the name of the object determining which database table is used.</p>

    <p>You can create an object of an existing blog post by passing the value of its primary key in to the constructor of the
    object:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  $objBlogPost = new BlogPost(2);</code></pre>

    <p>The database fields associated with that object are then made available through the properties of the object. For
    example:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  $objBlogPost = new BlogPost(2);
  echo $objBlogPost->blog_post_title; //Will echo 'Yesterday' to the screen</code></pre>

    <p>You can also set these properties and save the object back to the database:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  $objBlogPost = new BlogPost(2);
  $objBlogPost->blog_post_title = "Monday";
  $objBlogPost->save();</code></pre>

    <p>This code will update the database and set the title of Blog Post 2 to 'Monday'.</p>

    <p>Finally, you can delete the object by calling its delete method:

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  $objBlogPost = new BlogPost(2);
  $objBlogPost->delete();</code></pre>

    <p>Currently, this action will leave several comments 'orphaned' as they won't automatically be removed with the Blog Post.
    Cascading of actions like this needs to be handled manually. This can easily be done by using the relationships
    functionality detailed below.</p>

    <p>Finally, if a table has more than one field making up its primary key, you need to pass an array to the constructor
    instead consisting of the component parts. For example:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  $objGroupMembership = new GroupMembership(array('user_id' => 5, 'group_id' => 7));</code></pre>

    <h2>Relationships</h2>

    <p>Wings can also make use of relationships defined within the
    <span class="config"><a href="relationshipsconf.html">relationships.xml</a></span> config file in order to make accessing
    related objects very simple. The syntax of the config file is detailed on its documentation page, but you can define
    one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many relationships within it. In the example we are using on this page, there are 3
    one-to-many relationships defined - one between 'BlogPost' and 'User' on the field 'user_id', one between 'BlogPost' and
    'Comment' on the field 'blog_post_id', and one between 'Comment' and 'User' on the field 'user_id'.</p>

    <p>The basic syntax is <code>BaseModel->get<var>Name/NamePlural</var>()</code>, where <var>Name/NamePlural</var> is the name
    (or pluralised name) of the related object. Whether you use the plural form or not depends on the type of relationship, and
    therefore on the type of object you expect returned. This call can either return another model (where you need to use the
    singular version), or a <a href="collections.html">Collection</a> of models (where you need to use the plural version).</p>

    <p>For example, each Blog Post has one (and only one) User who posted it, but each User has several Blog Posts that they
    have posted. So, to get the User object for the User who posted Blog Post 3, you would use:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  $objBlogPost = new BlogPost(3);
  $objUser = $objBlogPost->getUser();
  echo $objUser->user_first_name . ' ' . $objUser->user_surname; //Will echo 'Chris Brown' to the screen</code></pre>

    <p>Similarly, to get a <a href="collections.html">Collection</a> of all the Blog Posts that User 1 has written:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  $objUser = new User(1);
  $objBlogPosts = $objUser->getBlogPosts(); //Will contain a collection of all of User 1's Blog Posts</code></pre>

    <p>The documentation for <a href="collections.html">Collections</a> has more detail on how to use and manipulate Collection
    objects.</p>

    <h2>Custom Functionality</h2>

    <p>If you want to create a model with custom methods and functionality, you can create a file called
    <span class="file">model.<var>name</var>.php</span> within <span class="folder">app/models/</span>, which will be loaded by
    the framework in preference to creating the class on the fly.</p>

    <p>The class within it must be named correctly (it is case-sensitive), and must extend the
    <a href="basemodel.html">BaseModel</a> class. This ensures it gains all the functionality detailed above.</p>

    <p>If you want to override any of the default methods, you must then call <code>parent::<var>methodName</var>()</code> at
    some point to ensure the basic functionality is still called. For example, to ensure that all Comments associated with a
    Blog Post are removed when deleting the Blog Post:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  class BlogPost extends BaseModel {
    public function delete () {
      $objComments = $this->getComments();
      $objComments->delete();

      parent::delete();
    }//function
  }//class</code></pre>

    <p>This file must be saved as <span class="file">app/models/model.blogpost.php</span> in order to be loaded and used by the
    system.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, the overridden method isn't required to call the original functionality. For example, you can have the
    <code>delete()</code> method not delete anything at all, but simply set a flag in the database instead:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  class BlogPost extends BaseModel {
    public function delete () {
      $this->deleted = 1;
      $this->save();
    }//function
  }//class</code></pre>
