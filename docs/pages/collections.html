    <h1>Collections</h1>

    <a href="../index.html" class="back">&lt; Back</a>

    <p>Collections represent a set of <a href="models.html">Models</a>, and are an automatically generated class. The name of
    the class consists of the name of the model that this collection consists of followed by the word 'Collection'. For example,
    a collection of users would be called UserCollection.</p>

    <p>There are several ways <a href="collection.html">Collection</a> objects enter the system - either by creating an empty
    collection and adding individual <a href="models.html">models</a> to it, as a return from a call to a
    <a href="models.html">model</a> to get related objects, or creating a collection of objects that meet certain
    conditions.</p>

    <p>The <a href="collection.html">Collection</a> class cannot be instantiated directly - only classes which extend from it
    can be used, and all of these are created by the <a href="loader.html">Loader</a> class automatically.</p>

    <p>The <a href="collection.html">Collection</a> class implements several internal PHP interfaces in order to make traversing
    and manipulating it easier. These interfaces are Iterator, Countable and ArrayAccess. The upshot of this is that a
    Collection can be treated as if it were an array of <a href="models.html">models</a>, but with the benefit of additional
    functionality as well.</p>

    <h2>Construction</h2>

    <p>To create an empty collection, and then add objects to it, you simply call the constructor with no parameters:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  $objComments = new CommentCollection();</code></pre>

    <p>You can then use the standard array syntax to add models to it:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  $objComments = new CommentCollection();

  $objComments[] = new Comment(1);
  $objComments[] = new Comment(3);</code></pre>

    <p>You can also create a Collection filled with models that meet certain conditions. To do this, you pass as SQL 'WHERE'
    clause into the constructor:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  $objComments = new CommentCollection('WHERE `blog_post_id` != 3');</code></pre>

    <p>The constructor can also take an 'ORDER BY' and/or 'LIMIT' statement to filter the collection further.</p>

    <p>To simply get a collection containing everything in the table, you simply pass an asterisk character into the
    constructor:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  $objComments = new CommentCollection('*');</code></pre>

    <p>You can also pass filtering statements ('WHERE', 'ORDER BY', 'LIMIT') into the call for related objects from another
    model. For example:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  $objComments = $objBlogPost->getComments('ORDER BY `user_id` DESC');</code></pre>

    <h2>Traversing</h2>

    <p>Manipulation &amp; traversing of collections happens in much the same way as with arrays:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  $objComments = $objBlogPost->getComments();

  $objFirstComment = $objComments[0];                    //You can use sqaure bracket notation to emulate Array Access

  if (count($objCollection) >= 1) {                      //You can use count() on collections
    echo "&lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n";

    foreach ($objComments as $objComment) {              //You can iterate through collections with foreach loops
      echo $objComment->comment_text . "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n";
    }//foreach
  }//if</code></pre>

    <h2>Manipulation</h2>

    <p>If you set any of the properties of the collection object, this will reflect on all the models within in. The same thing
    works for method calling. For example, if I wanted to change all comments by User 2 to be by User 14 instead:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
  //Either this:
  $objComments = new CommentCollection('WHERE `user_id` = 2');

  //Or this:
  $objUser = new User(2);
  $objComments = $objUser->getComments();

  $objComments->user_id = 14; //This sets user_id on all the models within the collection to 14 individually
  $objComments->save(); //This calls the save() method on all the models within Colection individually</code></pre>

    <p>The same principle can be used to delete all models within a collection by calling the <code>delete()</code> method on
    the collection, or any other custom method implemented in your models can be called.</p>
